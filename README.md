UNESCO World Heritage Site Tracker

Site Description
================

The Unesco World Heritage list comprises over 1000 of the world's outstanding cultural and natural sites.

They are a magnet for travellers, many of whom have challenged themselves to 'complete' the list. We came up with the idea of this site for our own enjoyment; to capture memories of sites we have visited, to be inspired by sites we have yet to see, and to make plans for the future. Why not join us in this journey? Step lightly, take only photographs, leave only footprints.

Purpose of this project
=======================

This is a personal learning project using Django / Python, as I'm currently re-skilling as a developer. Currently building with Django 1.7.1 and Python 3.4.
